This repo contains all the projects done during the IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate on Coursera.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The goal of the first assignment is to systematically explore any data. I decided to dive deeper into the Stroke Prediction Dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset). 
The notebook within the Exploratory_Data_Analysis folder explores the data set, executes some feature engineering and finally stores a pre-processed training and testing data set. They can later be used for directly performing some machine learning on them.
